\title{Maximum Detection Range}
\usage{
rmax(sl, nl, dt, d, a = 0, xaxis = 25)
}
\arguments{
\item{sl}{Source level of the signal of interest, as measured in dBs.}

\item{nl}{Noise Level or background ambient noise in the recorderâ€™s local environment.}

\item{dt}{Detection Threshold or the additional dBs the signal of interest must achieve above ambient noise conditions in order to be detected by the receiver.}

\item{d}{Depth}

\item{a}{The absorption coefficeant given to you by the absorptionAir or absorptionWater formula.}

\item{xaxis}{Exaggerated max distance. This gives the largest distance to evaluate in order to find the intercept of your detection threshold and propogation of the source level.}
}
\value{
The maximum detection range in meters
}
\description{
This function finds the maximum detection range of a given call.

# SL= 195, NL = 82.9897, DT = 10, TR = 2500
 rmax(sl=195,nl=82.9897,dt=10,d=2500*2, xaxis=10000000)
